# Victini

A Discord bot written in Python using Discord.py

Victini's primary function is to spin the [V-Wheel](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Victini_(Gates_to_Infinity)) daily and hoist the relevant Pok√©mon type roles (Fire, Grass, Electric, etc.) in the server for 24 hours.

Secondary functions include some user-facing commands, invoked using the `!` prfix. The current list of available commands are as follows:

| Command | Effects                                 | Permissions |
|----------|-----------------------------------------|-------------|
| !pet     | Pets Victini (They might not like that) | Everyone    |
